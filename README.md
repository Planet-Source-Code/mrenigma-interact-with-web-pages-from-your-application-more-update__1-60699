## Interact with web pages from your application \*\*\* MORE UPDATE \*\*\*


</div>

### Description

This little application was produced to show how you can interact with a web browser. its not complete in anyway, its just a starting point to show what you can do.

*** UPDATED *** I believe because of the improvements I should re-issue this code

I have heavily comments this demo code, this update shows some nifty things you can do, you can detect when the explorer window has mouse clicks / moves etc, exposes document events when they are fired.

I especially like onfocusin and onfocusout event, because these fire when the window loses focus or gains focus but also if you navigate to new location.
